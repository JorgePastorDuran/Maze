# Maze
Project developed in Unreal Engine with C++ and Blueprints.

1. The red cylinders represent the keys to open the doors of the same color. They won't open until you pick them up and hit the door.
2. The red boxes with a black X represent the Checkpoint points. The player will respawn at that location if their health reaches 0.
3. The multicolored spheres represent the game points. If the player reaches 7 points, he wins the game.
4. There are traps both on the floor and on the walls. If the player collides with them, he will lose his life.
5. If the player loses all lives they will be destroyed.

Author of the main song: Dennis Lloyd - Leftovers.
